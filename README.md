# üè† Ames Housing Price Prediction
A comprehensive analysis and machine learning project aimed at predicting housing prices in Ames, Iowa, using real estate features. This project combines data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building to derive meaningful insights and accurate price predictions.

## Project Title
A Comprehensive Analysis of Property Sale Prices in Ames: Predictive Modeling and Strategic Insights for Real Estate Investments

## Overview
This project was part of a module in my Master‚Äôs program and explores how various features influence house prices in Ames. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, correlation checks, modeling using multiple algorithms, and evaluation of model performance.

## What I Learned
As a student transitioning into data science, this project helped me strengthen the following core concepts:

- Data Preprocessing: I learned how to clean real-world datasets, handle missing values, and engineer meaningful features from raw data.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I gained experience using statistical visualizations to uncover relationships and trends in data.

- Regression Modeling: I explored and compared linear models (Linear, Ridge, and Lasso regression), and understood how regularization helps prevent overfitting.

- Model Evaluation: I learned how to evaluate models using metrics like RMSE and R¬≤ and make informed decisions based on results.

- R Markdown Reporting: I practiced presenting technical findings in a clean and structured HTML report, enhancing my data storytelling skills.

This project not only deepened my understanding of the data science pipeline but also showed me how to interpret model outputs in the context of a real-world business problem.

## Skills & Tools Used
-Languages: R, R Markdown

- Techniques: Data Wrangling, Feature Engineering, Regression Modeling, EDA

- Libraries/Packages: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, caret, corrplot, readr, data.table
